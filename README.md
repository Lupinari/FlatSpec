# FlatSpec
FlatSpec is the Python-based control engine for an SLM-based spectral equalizer in a Laser Frequency Comb. It uses a feedback loop to automatically and precisely flatten the intensity profile of the optical spectrum by controlling the amplitude of different frequency components via the SLM.
